Simple ECC implementation for learning purposes.

This project will be implemented in three phases:

1. Implement primitives and ECC key generation.			[DONE]
2. Implement ECC general purpose encryption/decryption.	[Done]
3. Implement ECC sign/verify.							[DEFINED]

See Implementation_Notes-Phase_1.txt for information about Phase 1 implementation.
See Implementation_Notes-Phase_2.txt for information about Phase 2 implementation.
