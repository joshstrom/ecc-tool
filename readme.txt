Simple ECC implementation for learning purposes.

This project will be implemented in three phases:

1. Implement primitives and ECC key generation.
2. Implement ECC general purpose encryption/decryption.
3. Implement ECC sign/verify.

Please note: this project is developed an OSX/XCode/GCC and has not yet 
been tested or built on a Windows/Visual Studio/Microsoft Visual Compiler environment.
