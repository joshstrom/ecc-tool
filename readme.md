# ECC Tool #


This is a scratch-built implementation of ECC created in C++ for learning purposes.
The implementation supports key generation, encryption/decryption, and sign/verify operations.

Please note: although this implementation does work for all tested standard ECC curves, it should
not be trusted for any sort of secure software without a security review. Please use a standard 
implementation of ECC for your project. This was developed to learn more about ECC (and associated
mathematical operations), C++, and as practice for cross-platform development.

This project was implemented in three phases:

1. Implement primitives and ECC key generation.             [DONE]
2. Implement ECC general purpose encryption/decryption.     [DONE]
3. Implement ECC sign/verify.                               [DONE]

* See [Implementation_Notes-Phase_1.txt](Implementation_Notes-Phase_1.txt) for information about Phase 1 implementation.
* See [Implementation_Notes-Phase_2.txt](Implementation_Notes-Phase_2.txt) for information about Phase 2 implementation.
* See [Implementation_Notes-Phase_3.txt](Implementation_Notes-Phase_2.txt) for information about Phase 3 implementation.
